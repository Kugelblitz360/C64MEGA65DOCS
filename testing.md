The C64 Core has been very extensively tested by **AmokPhaze101**. A full current testing protocol can be found at:

https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/master/tests/README.md

There also are specific lists of tested cartridges and tested demos:

https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/master/tests/demos.md

These tests show the extreme compatibility of the C64 Core.

Unfortunately this rigorous testing needs to be fully redone for the next version of the Core, and as this will take many **weeks** of work, it won't be done again soon. Because of this and other time-limitations, please do not expect a Core release higher than 5.2 in 2025.

If you find a piece of C64 software that does run on a PAL Commodore 64 but not on the C64 core, please be so kind to raise an issue at the Github so that this information is preserved and not lost in any of the online forums.
