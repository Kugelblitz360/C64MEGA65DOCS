Please do not expect a new release of the C64 Core before the end of 2025. The main team currently is working on other projects. If you want to speed up development, please come into the team! [All code is up on Github!](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65)

There also is a full [Roadmap](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) of planned new features and enhancements.

If you have additional suggestions or have found a bug, please open an issue at:

https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/issues

This is the central and only place to keep track of requests. Just asking in Discord or other forums is, unfortunately, not enough. Thank you!
