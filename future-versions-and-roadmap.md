**Please do not expect a release higher than 5.2 of the C64 Core in 2025.** The main team currently is working on other real life projects. If you want to speed up development, please come into the team! [All code is up on Github!](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65)

There also is a full [Roadmap](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) of planned new features and enhancements.

If you have additional suggestions or have found a bug, please open an issue at:

https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/issues

This is the central and only place to keep track of requests. Just asking in Discord or other forums is, unfortunately, not enough. Thank you!
