It can not simulate other drives and it does not simulate GCR-encoding images in<src>.g64</src>format. This means that no copy protected software will run when loaded as an image.</p><p>This “internal” 1541 drive always is device #8. This leads to conflicts when you connect a real 1541 (or similar) to the MEGA65 which is also a #8. Whenever you “mount” a .d64 image, make sure that you have no #8 device connected (or turn off the IEC bus).</p><p>The C64 Core can only mount images that are already stored on the SD Card. If you think you will need an empty .d64 image to save programs or games, you need to create them externally and put them on the SD Card first.</p><h2 id="connecting-an-external-drive">Connecting an external drive</h2><p>The MEGA65 has an IEC-Port for round plugs with six pins. You can directly connect ANY device that was built for the Commodore 64 and it should work as intended. This of course includes all revisions of the 1541 drive.</p><p>Additional extensions with extra cables (e.g. DolphinDOS) are not supported.</p><p>Please make sure that you do not mount a .d64 image when you have a device with the #8 on the IEC bus.</p><h2 id="sd2iec-and-pi1541">SD2IEC and Pi1541</h2><p>These modern solid-state replacements for 1541 drives are wide-spread and, in theory, fully supported. The hardware designs for these devices is open source and the software can be downloaded free of charge. This has lead to many different small vendors building devices based on these designs.</p><p>During our testing with the MEGA65 we have found a number of devices that have less-than-ideal implementations of the IEC bus. This bus, a child of the late 1970s, works by constantly having 5 volts power on its lines that can be “pulled down” by a device on the bus. Roughly, instead of the device issuing a signal it takes away the signal. This is a cool solution to daisy-chain devices, so having a device 8, 9 and 10 on the same wires and even able to use Y-cables to connect several devices.</p><p>But: You constantly power the lines of the bus with 5 Volts and the MEGA65 is really good in doing this. While the good old original hardware does not mind, some of modern IEC-devices show a phenomenom called “back powering”. <strong>Even if you do not connect them to power, they light up when you connect them to the IEC bus.</strong></p><p>We own several iterations of both the Pi1541 and SD2IEC that show this behaviour when connected to a R6 MEGA65 board. Once a device shows being affected by this back-powering, it also leads to further problems especially if you want several devices on the bus, with data transmission and sometimes even total crashes.</p><p>We were unable to test every device combination and especially the multitude of SD2IEC devices in the market. <em>As of the beginning of August 2024, the only device that reliably worked and showed no back-power problem is the SD2IEC+ device from tfw8b.com.</em> We will expand this to other devices proven to work in the upcoming weeks.</p><p><strong>When you are using an SD2IEC or Pi1541 device, take the following advice:</strong></p><ul><li>Get a really good power supply. Do not take the four year old cheap phone charger still lying around.</li><li>Test out whether the device LEDs light up or flicker when you have disconnected power to the device but the MEGA65 turns on. If you see this effect, please test your device thoroughly to make sure data transfer is not affected.</li><li>Do not connect more than one device to the IEC bus.</li></ul><p>More information on this will follow after further testing.</p></div><footer><div class="post__footer-top"><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-10T17:00">August 10, 2024 </time><span>Updated on: <time datetime="2024-08-10T17:00">August 10, 2024</time></span></div></div></footer></article></div><aside class="main__left-aside"><div class="main__left-aside__inner"><h3>On this page</h3><nav class="aside-toc" id="aside-toc"></nav></div></aside></div></div><div class="main__right"><div class="main__right-inner"><nav class="navbar"><ul class="navbar__menu"><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/c64formega65.html" target="_self">C64 for MEGA65</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/features.html" target="_self">Features (Old docs)</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/go64-vs-c64-core.html" target="_self">GO64 vs. C64 Core</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/installation.html" target="_self">Installation</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/vga-and-hdmi-output.html" target="_self">VGA and HDMI Output</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/resetting-the-core.html" target="_self">Resetting the Core</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/working-with-disks-and-drives.html" target="_self">Working with disks and drives</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/saving-data-with-the-c64-core.html" target="_self">Saving data with the C64 Core</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/c64-cartridges.html" target="_self">C64 Cartridges</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/jiffydos-and-alternative-kernals.html" target="_self">JiffyDOS and alternative Kernals</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/testing-the-core-for-release.html" target="_self">Testing the Core for Release</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/future-versions-and-roadmap.html" target="_self">Future versions and Roadmap</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/faq-and-other-stuff.html" target="_self">FAQ and other stuff</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer main__right-footer"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrap"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div></div></footer><div class="post__progress" id="js-post__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
