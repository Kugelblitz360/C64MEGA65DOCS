Please check the list to the right if you came here for a specific problem.</p><h2 id="top-issues">Top Issues</h2><p>Well, there really is no top five yet of questions repeated over and over yet, but these here have been asked more often than others. We tried to group similar issues in the full list so this just links to the full answers below.</p><p><strong>SD Card file corruption</strong> - please see <a href="#important-information-about-micro-sd-cards">here</a></p><p><strong>No picture on HDMI</strong> - please see <a href="#no-picture-on-a-connected-hdmi-display">here</a></p><p><strong>Cartridge/Hardware does not work</strong> - please see <a href="#i-can-not-run-a-specific-cartridgeextension">here</a> and <a href="#the-core-does-not-work-when-a-cartridge-is-inserted">here</a></p><p><strong>Keyboard does not work</strong> - please see <a href="#the-keyboard-is-not-working">here</a></p><p><strong>Barcode like display</strong> - please see <a href="#unsual-picture-after-a-reset-barcode">here</a></p><p><strong>My game progress is gone after reboot</strong> - please see <a href="#i-saved-a-game-but-when-i-reboot-it-is-gone">here</a></p><h2 id="video-issues">Video Issues</h2><h4 id="no-picture-on-a-connected-hdmi-display">No picture on a connected HDMI display</h4><p>Pl##ease check <a href="vga-and-hdmi-output.html#hdmi-troubleshooting">here</a></p><h4 id="strange-picture-on-a-vga-display">Strange picture on a VGA display</h4><p>Please try the <strong>Auto Adjust</strong> function on your VGA display, especially when switching screen modes or turning Flicker Free on or off.</p><p>If you are using a flat screen rather than a bulky CRT, please do not use the 15 KHz modes.</p><h4 id="unsual-picture-after-a-reset-barcode">Unsual picture after a Reset (“barcode”)</h4><p>A small but significant number of users have reported a problem with the C64 Core only showing vertical bars after a RESET or irregularly after a number of minutes. It looks like this:</p><img loading="lazy" src="barcode1.webp" style="width:200px" data-is-external-image="true"> <img loading="lazy" src="barcode2.webp" style="width:200px" data-is-external-image="true"><p>This behaviour is limited to R6 boards and is a very specific timing issue with the so-called “HyperRAM” component of the MEGA65. There is a temporary fix available in form of a new Alpha version of the Core. The only change is regarding this specific behaviour, but it can not be ruled out that the fix has negative side effects. If you want to install this version of the Core, please click the following link to download the installation files and follow the usual procedures:</p><p><a href="https://t.ly/ujcev">https://t.ly/ujcev</a></p><p>You can also install the released version of the Core and this specific fixed version in different slots of the MEGA65 for comparison.</p><p><strong>Do not install this version of the Core unless you repeatedly see those vertical bars.</strong></p><h2 id="loading-and-running-games">Loading and Running Games</h2><h4 id="how-do-i-load-a-game">How do I load a game?</h4><p>If you have stored C64 software on your SD Card, there are three ways:</p><ul><li>A CRT-file for a cartridge will automatically start after you have mounted it.</li><li>A PRG-file that you loaded will be automatically started if it is a standard program - if it does not autostart, it is either not a full programm (data files often also carry the prg extension) or requires start with a SYS command and a startadress that the Core can not know.</li><li>A D64-file is a mounted disk image. The C64 never autostarted disks. You manually have to load a programm first. Unless several programs are stored on the same disk, please type in the following command:</li></ul><p><code>LOAD &quot;*&quot;,8,1</code></p><p>and press <kbd>Return</kbd> and wait (the 1541 disk drive is VERY slow in its original state). In some cases you then need to start the programm by typing</p><p><code>RUN</code></p><p>and pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>.</p><h4 id="a-game-or-demo-does-not-run-correctly">A game or demo does not run correctly</h4><p>Please check the following list of potential solutions:</p><ul><li>Is the game/demo compatible with PAL? The Core does not support NTSC-only software.</li><li>Have you turned on the REU emulation? This is not compatible with many games and should usually be switched off.</li><li>Have you tried turning off “HDMI Flicker-Free”? It does help with some very timing-intolerant programs and especially original copy protections.</li><li>Some modern demos require the specific timing of the 8521 CIA. Turn it on by selecting “CIA: Use 8521 (C64C)”. Turn it off for any game you are playing, we have seen instances of games behaving weirdly when this is turned on.</li><li>Try power cycling the MEGA65. A simple reset might leave residues in the C64 memory that interferes with some programs.</li><li>Do you have additional devices on the IEC bus? Some programs refuse to run if they see a device #9, #10 and so on.</li><li>Some programs refuse to run when JiffyDOS is active, switch to the standard Kernal.</li><li>Some programs won’t run when loaded as a PRG from a directory on a SD2IEC device. Try mounting it in a .d64 on the SD2IEC or the Core instead (although there also are limits to the compatibility).</li><li>Some copy-protected programs require a real 1541 drive or an exact 1541 emulation. Currently the Core does support a Pi1541-device on the IEC bus (and thinks it is a real 1541). Ultimate64 devices currently do not work. The 1541 emulation in the Core might be upgraded to a similar level of compatibility to these devices in the next version (end of 2025!).</li></ul><p>If you find some game or demo that still does not work, be so kind to create an issue in the official Github: <a href="https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/issues">https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/issues</a></p><h4 id="a-specific-prg-file-will-not-work">A specific .prg file will not work</h4><p>There are some programming tricks with some very special <code>.prg</code> files that load into specific memory locations that will simply not work with the fast direct load of the Core. Put the <code>.prg</code> file into a .d64, mount the disk, and it should work.</p><h2 id="general-menu-usage">General Menu Usage</h2><h4 id="the-screen-goes-black-when-i-select-jiffydos">The screen goes black when I select JiffyDOS</h4><p>As JiffyDOS is commercial software, it is not included. Please see the section on <a href="jiffydos-and-alternative-kernals.html">JiffyDOS</a>.</p><h4 id="the-built-in-freezer-does-not-work">The built-in freezer does not work</h4><p>Unfortunately the MEGA65 calls its system menu a <em>Freezer</em> but on the C64 this is usually something slightly different. The MEGA65 Freezer ist part of the MEGA65 and can not be accessed when any other core, including the C64 Core, is active. Because the C64, unlike the C65, had no <kbd>Help</kbd> button, it uses this instead of <kbd>Restore</kbd> to access the Core menu.</p><p>The <kbd>Restore</kbd>-Key of the C64 calls a “Non-Maskable Interrupt” which can be used in conjunction with some of the well know freezer cartridges and is used in some demos or games, for example to reset game options to their default.</p><p>Please also see the documentation about cartridges, especially <a href="c64-cartridges.html#freezer-cartridges">this section</a>.</p><h4 id="the-file-browser-does-not-display-all-files">The file browser does not display all files</h4><p>First of all, the file browser will only display files with the currently appropriate extension, i.e. when mounting a disk, it will only show directories and <code>.d64</code> files. Also there is a limit of roughly 625 directory entries per directory, so putting for example all files from the OneLoad collection into one directory will not work. Try to keep a directory to a maximum of 500 files or subdirectories (you can nest directories very deep). Try creating directories for every first letter of the files or sort your games by genres or developers.</p><h4 id="the-file-browser-does-not-react">The file browser does not react</h4><p>If you have many files in a directory, the file browser needs a few seconds to gather all information. Unfortunately you currently get no visual feedback that the file browser is working. Please wait a few seconds and also make sure that you do not have hundreds of files in a directory.</p><h4 id="how-can-i-pause-the-c64">How can I pause the C64?</h4><p>Just like a real C64, the C64 Core for the MEGA65 has no pause function. If you need pause functionality, you might want to look at C64 emulation on a PC instead.</p><h4 id="the-core-forgets-the-settings-after-a-reboot">The Core forgets the settings after a reboot</h4><p>The Core requires a settings file with a specific length in a specific place. If this file is not there when the Core starts, it will not save settings. Please check <a href="installation.html#config-file">here</a>.</p><h2 id="input-problems">Input Problems</h2><h4 id="the-keyboard-is-not-working">The keyboard is not working</h4><p>If your keyboard is working while you are using the MEGA65 core but you cannot type properly while using the C64 core and the <kbd>Help</kbd> menu works fine then please check if you have an <strong>Amiga Mouse</strong> or a joystick or other device with activated auto-fire connected to port #1. If so, please remove it and you will be able to type properly. Please also see the section on <a href="joysticks-paddles-mice.html">Joystick and Mouse</a>.</p><h4 id="the-mouse-is-not-working">The mouse is not working</h4><p>The C64 Core, unlike the MEGA65 core, does <strong>not</strong> support Amiga-style mice. You need to use a C64 compatible mouse. Please see the section on <a href="joysticks-paddles-mice.html">Joystick and Mouse</a>.</p><h4 id="the-paddle-is-not-working">The paddle is not working</h4><p>There are several lists on the internet that claim that certain games (e.g. Krakout) could be played with a paddle. Most of these lists are unfortunately wrong. If a game does not specifically mention paddle control in the title screen, it most likely does not have it.</p><h4 id="my-lightgun-is-not-working">My lightgun is not working</h4><p>Lightguns require a 15 KHz VGA setup and will not work with HDMI or any flatscreen TFT.</p><h4 id="a-gamepad--joystick-is-not-working">A gamepad / joystick is not working</h4><p>The C64 Core is incompatible with controllers designed for SEGA consoles, the CD32, the Atari 7800 and the 3DO, even if they have the same plug. Please see the section on <a href="joysticks-paddles-mice.html">Joystick and Mouse</a>.</p><h2 id="saving-data">Saving data</h2><h4 id="i-saved-a-game-but-when-i-reboot-it-is-gone">I saved a game but when I reboot, it is gone</h4><p>Most likely you have used an Easyflash or Gmod version of a game mounted as a virtual cartridge. Unfortunately the Core does not write back the cartridge memory to the SD card when it is changes. You need to find a version of the game that saves games to a mounted <code>.d64</code> image (or a connected real drive). Also make sure that you created an image for saved games before starting the game, as the Core can not create empty disks for you. For your convenience you can download an empty disk image <a href="empty.d64">here</a>.</p><h4 id="i-need-to-save-something-to-an-empty-disk">I need to save something to an empty disk</h4><p>The C64 Core can not create of format disks. You need to have some spare empty <code>.d64</code> files on your SD Card. For your convenience you can download an empty disk image <a href="empty.d64">here</a>.</p><h2 id="disk-drive-issues">Disk drive issues</h2><h4 id="i-can-not-hear-any-drive-sounds">I can not hear any drive sounds</h4><p>That is correct. The C64 Core does not have emulated drive sounds when a <code>.d64</code> is mounted</p><h4 id="i-can-not-format-a-d64-file">I can not format a .d64 file</h4><p>That is correct. While most commands that access the contents of a .d64 file work, the format routine of the virtual 1541 does not. You need to create empty .d64 files with a different tool.</p><h4 id="i-can-not-open-a-specific-d64-file">I can not open a specific .d64 file</h4><p>The C64 Core does not support .d64 files that include error maps. Please see <a href="working-with-disks-and-drives.html#supported-d64-variations">here</a></p><h4 id="i-can-not-access-the-35-inch-disk-drive">I can not access the 3.5 inch disk drive</h4><p>That is correct. The C64 Core does not access the internal disk drive of the MEGA65.</p><h2 id="other-hardware-issues">Other hardware issues</h2><h4 id="i-can-not-run-a-specific-cartridgeextension">I can not run a specific cartridge/extension</h4><p>The C64 Core has not yet implemented a 100% version of the cartridge port. Cartridges with very special timing or DMA access do not work. Prominent examples are Kernal replacement in EasyFlash3, the Ultimate II(+) and the physical REU units. Find out more about this <a href="c64-cartridges.html">here</a>.</p><h4 id="the-core-does-not-work-when-a-cartridge-is-inserted">The Core does not work when a cartridge is inserted</h4><p>You might have to update the MEGA65 CORE #0. This issue is described <a href="installation.html#issues-with-cartridge-compatibility">here</a>.</p><h4 id="i-cant-connect-to-a-network">I can’t connect to a network</h4><p>That is correct. The C64 Core does not use the Ethernet port. You need to be in MEGA65 mode for all network transfers.</p><h2 id="hacks-tips-and-tricks">Hacks, Tips and Tricks</h2><h4 id="how-can-i-power-peripherals-that-are-plugged-into-the-tape-port-of-a-c64">How can I power peripherals that are plugged into the tape port of a C64?</h4><p>The MEGA65 does not have a tape port, some devices like some SD2IEC versions use the tape port to get their 5 Volts. There is a hack to get this from a location on the MEGA65 motherboard described in the Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/719326990221574164/1271433803386060845/1271433803386060845">here</a>. This is a hack and could theoretically damage hardware, so is only recommended if you really know what you are doing.</p><h4 id="can-i-replace-the-c64-kernal-with-my-own">Can I replace the C64 Kernal with my own?</h4><p>Currently you can have one other Kernal by naming your files specifically and selecting JiffyDOS in the Core. Please find instructions <a href="jiffydos-and-alternative-kernals.html#installing-other-kernals-than-jiffydos">here</a>.</p><h4 id="can-i-change-the-color-palette-of-the-c64-core">Can I change the color palette of the C64 Core?</h4><p>The C64 Core uses carefully measured colors that are as close as possible to the PAL C64 output. These colors look pale, especially compared to NTSC machines, but are currently your only option. So no, you can not change the palette.</p><h4 id="can-the-core-run-geos">Can the Core run GEOS?</h4><p>Yes. Please find full instructions in a PDF file here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/39afa07d79ab92b67f72dac71a538bf558a7d703/doc/GEOS_WITH_THE_C64_CORE.pdf">https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/39afa07d79ab92b67f72dac71a538bf558a7d703/doc/GEOS_WITH_THE_C64_CORE.pdf</a></p><h2 id="important-information-about-micro-sd-cards">Important information about Micro SD Cards</h2><p><strong>First and foremost: Always use the proper command for your computers operating system to <em>eject</em> the SD card when you added files to it via your PC. If you just take it out it might damage the filesystem because write caches have not been written fully.</strong> This is true for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android or whatever other clever device you use. Even the MEGA65. If you write files to the SD Card while in MEGA65 mode via the Ethernet connection, you should always wait a second or two before resetting or turning off the MEGA65. Writes are done immediately, but modern SD cards have an internal cache and if they lose power during a write cycle you will get data loss. 90% of all errors on SD cards can be traced back to them being taken out of a desktop/laptop computer without using the respective eject command first.</p><p>Do not use Micro SD Cards larger than 32 GB.</p><p>Please make sure that your Micro SD Card has been formatted either by the MEGA65 tool or by the official Micro SD Card formatting software found here for various operating systems:</p><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/">https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/</a></p><p>The Operating System of your computer might offer to format “FAT32” but in reality you might get extra unwanted files, small other issues and in the end a not 100% compatible card. Also refrain from partitioning the card into several partitions.</p><p>Please immediately after formatting the card create a directory called <code>c64</code> and copy the Config File called <code>c64mega65</code> into it. It needs to be the version that came with the installed version of the Core, <em>it needs to be exactly the correct size!</em></p><p>Please use a good brand-name card like Samsung, Verbatim or SanDisk. They are really cheap these days anyway.</p><p>If you see oddities with your card, your best option is to take a computer, copy all the files off the card, format it, then copy all the files back to the card in order to have a proper file and directory structure. And don’t forget to eject.</p><h2 id="unexplainable-general-weird-behaviour">Unexplainable general weird behaviour</h2><p>There is a hardware problem with the older R3 revisions and its HDMI output. A monitor that is plugged in can <strong>back power</strong> the MEGA65. This will lead to all kinds of problems especially with the SD card access ending in overall instability of the whole system.</p><p><strong>You can skip the following paragraphs if your MEGA65 is an R6 revision.</strong></p><p>If your MEGA65 is connected to any HDMI device: Never switch-on this device before you have successfully switched-on your MEGA65. Or to put it the other way round: <strong>Always switch-on your MEGA65 first</strong> and <strong>THEN</strong> switch-on your HDMI device (monitor, frame grabber, etc.).</p><p>For the C64 core this means: While your MEGA65 and your HDMI device are switched off: Hold the <kbd>No Scroll</kbd> key while you switch on the MEGA65 and while the HDMI device is still off. Now, you can switch on your HDMI device and use the MEGA65’s core selection menu to select the C64 core. You can also use the key combination <kbd>No Scroll</kbd> + <em>number of the C64 core in the core menu</em> to directly select the C64 core.</p><p>Another way to resolve the issue is to put a cheap HDMI switch between the MEGA65 and your device. You will find two Amazon links to devices that are known to work <a href="https://dansanderson.com/mega65/welcome/hardware-issues.html?highlight=hdmi#failure-to-boot-and-keyboard-lights-glow-when-off">here in Dan’s MEGA65 Welcome Guide</a>.</p></div><footer><div class="content__footer-top"><div class="content__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-10T14:35">August 10, 2024 </time><span>Updated on: <time datetime="2024-09-08T20:07">September 8, 2024</time></span></div></div></footer></article></div><aside class="main__left-aside"><div class="main__left-aside__inner"><h3>On this page</h3><nav class="aside-toc" id="aside-toc"></nav></div></aside></div></div><div class="main__right"><div class="main__right-inner"><nav class="navbar"><ul class="navbar__menu"><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/" target="_self">Start Page</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/features.html" target="_self">Overview of Features</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/installation.html" target="_self">MEGA65 Revisions and Installation</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/the-main-menu.html" target="_self">The Main Menu</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/working-with-the-file-browser.html" target="_self">The File Browser</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/go64-vs-c64-core.html" target="_self">GO64 vs. C64 Core</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/vga-and-hdmi-output.html" target="_self">VGA and HDMI Output</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/audio-output-and-sid.html" target="_self">Audio output and SID</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/joysticks-paddles-mice.html" target="_self">Joysticks and other controllers</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/working-with-disks-and-drives.html" target="_self">Working with disks and drives</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/saving-data-with-the-c64-core.html" target="_self">Saving data with the C64 Core</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/c64-cartridges.html" target="_self">C64 Cartridges</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/the-1750-ram-expansion-unit.html" target="_self">The 1750 RAM Expansion Unit</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/jiffydos-and-alternative-kernals.html" target="_self">JiffyDOS and alternative Kernals</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/resetting-the-core.html" target="_self">Resetting the Core</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/testing.html" target="_self">Testing the Core for Release</a></li><li><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/future-versions-and-roadmap.html" target="_self">Future versions and Roadmap</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kugelblitz360.github.io/C64MEGA65DOCS/faq-and-other-stuff.html" target="_self">Troubleshooting and FAQ</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer main__right-footer"><div class="footer__copy">Created with Publii and ProDocs by Boris Schneider-Johne</div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrap"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copy">Created with Publii and ProDocs by Boris Schneider-Johne</div></div></div></footer><div class="content__progress" id="js-content__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
